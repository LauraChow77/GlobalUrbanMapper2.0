# `mapping` Directory
This is the prediction code directory for the Global Urban Mapper (GUM) 2.0 project. It provides the necessary scripts and resources to perform urban mapping using the GUM 2.0 model. The inclusion of Colab-compatible code ensures that researchers without personal GPU resources can leverage the GPUs provided by Google Colab.

## Contents

This directory contains the following important files and resources:

- `global_urban_mapping_os.ipynb`: A Colab notebook designed for executing the global urban mapping process.

## Download model

## Making Predictions
To initiate the urban mapping prediction with the `GUM 2.0` model, please refer to the instructions and code within `global_urban_mapping_os.ipynb`.
