**<span style="font-size: 150em;">INTRODUCTION</span>**

**GUM 2.0** is a robust multimodal urban mapping solution designed to handle incomplete modality observations effectively. Users can leverage this code to map specific urban areas using complete or incomplete Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and topographic data.

As a deep learning model, GUM 2.0 has demonstrated its effectiveness in various downstream tasks, including road extraction, building identification, building height estimation, and LCZ (Local Climate Zone) mapping.

- To use **GUM 2.0** for urban mapping, please refer to the detailed guidelines in the **`mapping`** folder.  
- To train the incomplete learning algorithm, follow the specific instructions in the **`algorithm`** folder.  

**GUM 2.0** supports the monitoring of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering researchers and practitioners a flexible, efficient model for urban mapping and the extraction of urban-related elements under varying modality availabilities.
