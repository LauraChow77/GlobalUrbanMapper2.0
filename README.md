## INTRODUCTION

**GUM 2.0** is a robust multimodal urban mapping solution designed to handle incomplete modality observations effectively. Users can leverage this code to map specific urban areas using complete or incomplete Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and topographic data.

As a deep learning model, GUM 2.0 has demonstrated its effectiveness in various downstream tasks, including road extraction, building identification, building height estimation, and LCZ (Local Climate Zone) mapping.

**GUM 2.0** supports the monitoring of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering researchers and practitioners a flexible, efficient model for urban mapping and the extraction of urban-related elements under varying modality availabilities.

## Repository Overview: Structure and Components
This repository is organized into three primary folders:
- **`gee_code`**: Contains data preprocessing scripts implemented using Google Earth Engine.
- **`algorithm`**: Houses the code for the incomplete‑learning algorithm.
- **`mapping`**: Provides detailed guidelines for using GUM 2.0 to perform urban mapping in Google Colab, enabling users without local GPU resources to generate urban maps independently.
